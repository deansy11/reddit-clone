## Reddit Clone Project

# This is an application to practice using AngularJS in the Rails framework.
The project will mimic the structure and functionality of Reddit/Hacker News, where users will be able to do the following:

  * Create new posts
  * View all posts ordered by upvotes
  * Add comments about a given post
  * View comments for a given post
  * Upvote posts and comments
  * Create a user authentication system using the Devise gem.

 # This project is created using the 'Thinkster' tutorial 'Learn to Build Modern Web Apps with AngularJS and Ruby on Rails'.
